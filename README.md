# SnipIt

If you're migrating to a new editor you can use this package to convert your existing code snippets to the format that your new IDE requires.  
Check out the [playground examples](https://github.com/atacan/SnipIt/tree/main/Sources/PlayConversion.playground/Pages).

It will soon be available in [Dime a Dozen](https://github.com/atacan/Dime-a-Dozen) app.
